Capstone Project part 2 for udacity

In this app user can read news from ThaiPBS in english. App will get news automatic in background and show notification if there is any new news. user can save news in readlist if they want to read it later.
I use Sync Adpater to get data from ThaiPBS in rss and use earl libray to parse data then put it in content provider.

This a source code for Thai news update! get it here : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.hanthong.capstone
